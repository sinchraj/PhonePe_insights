# PhonePe_insights
A narrative-driven, "Stress-Proof" spending tracker for PhonePe designed to eliminate the Ostrich Effect. Instead of raw numbers and financial guilt, it uses Humble AI to cluster messy transactions into relatable life stories like "The Bangalore Crawl" or "Festive Orbit."
The Problem: Most fintech apps act like "Scolding Accountants," showing raw currency totals that trigger financial anxiety and cause users to avoid the app during high-spend periods (The Ostrich Effect).

The Solution:

Narrative UI: Instagram-style stories that lead with "Vibes" (e.g., "Comfort food vibes this week 🍜") rather than "Categories."

Emotional Firewall: Hides specific Rupee totals behind a "Tell me more" link, allowing users to engage with their data only when they feel emotionally ready.

Humble AI Logic: Uses MCC codes, timestamps, and city-level context to detect life patterns (Clustering) rather than auditing individual line items.

Correction Loop: Features "Spot on" and "Not quite" feedback loops to empower the user to train their own financial narrative.

Key Features:

Weekly Rituals: A low-friction header icon that refreshes weekly to prevent information overload.

The Archive: A structured history tab organized by "Weekly Chapters" and "Monthly Unlocked" recaps.

Contextual Validation: AI that recognizes vacations and festivals to validate spending rather than flagging it as a failure.
